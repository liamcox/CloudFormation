Section 6: Cloudformation Outputs
	What are outputs?
		-The outputs section declares optional output value that we can import into our stacks
		-You can always view the outputs in the AWS console or in using the AWS CLI
		-They are very useful for example if you define a Network cloud configuration, 	 and output the variable such as the VPC ID and your subnet IDs
		-Itâ€™s the best way to perform some collaboration across stack, as you let experts handle their own part of the stack

	Cross stack reference hands on
		-We then create a second template that leverages the security group
		-For this, we use the Fn::ImportValue function
		-You can't delete the underlined stack until all the references are deleted too
