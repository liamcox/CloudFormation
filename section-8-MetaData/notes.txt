Section 8: Cloudformation MetaData

	What is metadata?
		-you can use the optional meta-data section to include arbitrary Yaml that provide details about the template or resource
		
	Special metadata keys:
		-there are three metadata keys that have special meaning:
			1.AWS::CloudFormation::Designer : describes how the resources are 			laid out in your template. This is automatically added by the AWS designer.
			2.AWS::CloudFormation::Interface : define grouping and ordering of input 	parameters when they are displayed in the AWS console.
			3.AWS::CloudFormation::Init: define configuration tasks for cfn-init. It's 	the most powerful usage of the metadata

    AWS::CloudFormation::Interface Hands On: 
        - Define grouping and ordering of input parameters when they are displayed in the AWS console
        - This is meant when users must input template parameters manually
        - You provide them with grouping, or sorting, that allows them to input parameters efficiently.
