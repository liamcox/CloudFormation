Section 2: first hands on

CloudFormation Building Blocks:
Template Components: 
	1.Resources: your AWS resources declared in the template
	2.Parameters: the dynamic inputs for your template
	3.Mapping’s: the static variables for your template
	4.Outputs: references to what has been created
	5.Conditionals: list of conditions to perform resource creation
	6.Metadata

Overview of YAML:
	-key value pairs
	-nested objects
	-supported arrays
	-Multi line strings
	-Can include comments

Things to remember about Yaml:

It’s a key value pair using a colon to separate the key from the value. To create a new objects you are going to indent. To create an array use a “-“. To create an array of objects you'll have a dash and then return to a new line on the same indent.

Using CloudFormation Designer 
	-The cloud formation designer can really help visualize a cloud formation stack
	-It’s also very handy to just quickly draft a cloud formation template
	-It has strong capabilities to verify that your template is also well written
