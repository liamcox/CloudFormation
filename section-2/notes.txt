Section 2: first hands on

Overview of YAML:
	-key value pairs
	-nested objects
	-supported arrays
	-Multi line strings
	-Can include comments

Things to remember about Yaml:

It’s a key value pair using a colon to separate the key from the value. To create a new objects you are going to indent. To create an array use a “-“. To create an array of objects you'll have a dash and then return to a new line on the same indent.
