Section 10: Cloudformation Drift:

	What is Drift?
		-Cloud formation allows you to create infrastructure
		-But it doesn't protect you against manual configuration changes
		-How do we know if our resources have drifted? We can use cloud formation 		drift

    How it can be implementated:
        -Can be used to see how resources have been manually changed
        -Can manually change resources and then check the code and copy paste it into your template
        -Its more of an audit and can't prevent manual changes from happening.
