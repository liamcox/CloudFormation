SECTION 1: AWS CLOUDFORMATION INTRODUCTION

WHAT IS CLOUDFORMATION:
    is a declarative way of outlining your AWS infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported)
    For example, within a cloud formation template, you say:
        I want a security group
        I want to EC2 machines using the security group
        I want to elastic IP's for these EC2 machines
        I want an S3 bucket
        I want a load balancer in front of these machines
        Then cloud formation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

BENEFITS OF AWS CLOUDFORMATION:
Infrastructure as Code
    No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
    The code can be version controlled for example using git
    Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through Code

Cost
    Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack cost you
    You can estimate the cost of your resources using the cloud formation template
    Saving strategy: in Dev, you can automate deletion of templates at 5 PM and re-create at 8 AM, safely

Productivity 
    Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
    Automated generation of diagram for your templates
    Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)

Separation of concern: create money stacks for many apps, and many layers. Example:
    VPC stacks
    Networks stacks
    Application stacks

Don't reinvent the wheel:
    Leverage existing templates on the web
    Leverage the documentation
