Section 5: CloudFormation mappings

What are mappings?
	-Mappings are fixed variables within your cloud formation template.
	-They are very handy to differentiate between different environments (dev vs prod), 			regions (AWS regions, AMI types, etc
	-All the values are hardcoded within the template

When would you use mappings vs parameters?
	-Map things are great when you know in advance all the values that can be taken and 			that they can be deduced from variables such as
		-Region
		-Availability Zone
		-AWS Account
		-Environment (dev vs prod)
		-etcâ€¦
	-They allow safer control over the template
	-Use parameters when the values are really user specific

Fn:: FindInMap, accessing mapping values
	We use Fn:: FindInMap to return a named value from a specific key
	!FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ]

Concept: pseudo parameters:
	AWS offers pseudo parameters in any cloud formation template
	These can be used at any time and are enabled by default
	Examples:
		AWS::AcountId: 12345678
		AWS::NotificationARNs: [arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic ]
		AWS::NoValue: Does not return a value
		AWS::Region: us-east-2
		AWS::StackId: returns the stack id
		AWS::StackName: MyStack
